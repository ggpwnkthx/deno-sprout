## Checklist

Look for:

- `await req.text()`, `await req.json()`, `Deno.readTextFile`, `response.text()` on large inputs
- unbounded arrays, maps, caches, queues, or buffering
- missing pagination, cursors, limits, batching, or streaming
- repeated filters/scans inside loops
- repeated JSON serialization
- eager loading before filtering
- O(n^2) behavior where maps/sets/indexes would work
